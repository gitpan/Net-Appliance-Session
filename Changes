    - Bug in SSH Transport that would catch someone out one day
0.11  Sun Jan 28 20:54:00 GMT 2007
    - Add CheckPB option to allow (almost) complete disabling of phrasebook
      entry checks
    - Separate out phrasebook entry checking in case not all required (e.g.
      not going to use configure mode)
    - Add special Match argument to cmd() allowing operation more like
      Net::Telnet's waitfor()
    - Add Opts option to SSH Engine to support arbitrary openssh args

    - Remove all hard-coded command phrases and prompt regexps, they are now
      pulled from the loaded phrasebook so can be overridden
    - Check all phrases are actually in the loaded phrasebook at instantiation
      time and die if any are not available
    - As a result, now require Net::Appliance::Phrasebook >= 0.07
    - Allow user to disable login (user/pass) negotiation e.g. for public
      route servers
    - Also allow user to disable paging management, or override the number of
      lines used to re-enable paging
    - Also allow user to disable privileged and configure modes (see docs)
    - New Transport for Serial Line access, called 'Serial' (not tested much)
    - New Transport for Telnet access, called 'Telnet' (not tested much)
    - Factor out the IO::Pty code into Transport base class. Also checked it
      out, and it's actually pretty sane, so can stay in.
