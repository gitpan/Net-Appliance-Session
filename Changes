    - Remove all hard-coded command phrases and prompt regexps, they are now
      pulled from the loaded phrasebook so can be overridden
    - Check all phrases are actually in the loaded phrasebook at instantiation
      time and die if any are not available
    - As a result, now require Net::Appliance::Phrasebook >= 0.07
    - Allow user to disable login (user/pass) negotiation e.g. for public
      route servers
    - Also allow user to disable paging management, or override the number of
      lines used to re-enable paging
    - Also allow user to disable privileged and configure modes (see docs)
    - New Transport for Serial Line access, called 'Serial' (not tested much)
    - New Transport for Telnet access, called 'Telnet' (not tested much)
    - Factor out the IO::Pty code into Transport base class. Also checked it
      out, and it's actually pretty sane, so can stay in.
